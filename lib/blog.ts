    <h1>üìä Tracking Biometrics: What Actually Moves the Needle</h1>
    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Biometrics aren't just numbers‚Äîthey're accountability. Knowing how often clients sleep, rest, recover, and move can elevate your coaching. Here's how to implement it smartly.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Biometric Revolution in Coaching</h2>
    <p>Walk into any modern gym and you'll see it: clients obsessing over step counts, trainers analyzing heart rate zones, and everyone wearing some form of tracking device. But here's the thing‚Äî<strong>most people are tracking the wrong metrics</strong>.</p>
    <p>The fitness industry is drowning in data but starving for insights. Your client's Apple Watch says they burned 847 calories, but are they actually recovering? Their sleep app shows 7 hours, but was it quality sleep? Their scale went up 2 pounds‚Äîis that muscle or water retention?</p>
    <p><strong>Smart coaches track what matters. Average coaches track everything.</strong></p>

    <h2>The Great Coaching Software Debate</h2>
    <p>Walk into any gym and you'll hear trainers debating: <strong>MyFitnessPal vs. Trainerize</strong>, <strong>TrueCoach vs. TrainerRoad</strong>. But there's a silent majority using something else entirely‚Äî<strong>Google Sheets</strong>.</p>
    <p>While everyone's chasing the latest coaching app, seasoned trainers are quietly building empires on spreadsheets. Here's why (and when it backfires).</p>

    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Still relying on DMs and WhatsApp back-and-forths? You're losing clients while checking your phone. A <strong>booking page</strong> converts scrolls into sessions while you sleep.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Why Booking Pages Work (Especially for Fitness Coaches)</h2>
    <h3>The Problem with Manual Booking</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Endless back-and-forth</strong>: "What times work?" "How about Tuesday?" "Actually, Wednesday is better..."</li>
      <li><strong>Missed opportunities</strong>: Clients book with competitors while you're training</li>
      <li><strong>Unprofessional appearance</strong>: DMs make you look like a side hustle, not a business</li>
      <li><strong>Time vampire</strong>: Hours spent on scheduling instead of coaching</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Booking Page Solution</h3>
    <p>‚úÖ <strong>Removes friction</strong>: No back-and-forth messaging<br>
    ‚úÖ <strong>Looks professional</strong>: Shows you're serious about your business<br>
    ‚úÖ <strong>SEO-friendly</strong>: Rank for "book personal training sessions online"<br>
    ‚úÖ <strong>Works 24/7</strong>: Converts clients while you sleep<br>
    ‚úÖ <strong>Mobile-optimized</strong>: 73% of bookings happen on phones</p>
