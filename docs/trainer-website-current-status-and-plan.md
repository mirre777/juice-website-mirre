## üîß RECENT FIXES (v216-v219)

### **Payment Webhook Issue Resolution (v33)**
- **Issue**: Payment events not reaching backend, trainers not being activated after payment
- **Root Cause**: Webhook only handled `checkout.session.completed` but payment flow uses Payment Intents

- **Result**: Database now properly updates `isActive: true`, `isPaid: true`, and `status: "active"` after payment

- **Issue**: Merge conflicts between different development branches
- **Solution**: Reverted to working v216, then restored as v219
- **Result**: Clean codebase with all functionality intact

### **TrainerProfilePage Integration**
- **Issue**: Live profiles not displaying edited content properly
- **Solution**: Fixed content integration between editor and live profiles
- **Result**: Seamless editing experience with real-time updates

### **API Route Stability**
- **Issue**: Content API endpoints had inconsistent behavior
- **Solution**: Ensured proper Firebase integration and error handling
- **Result**: Reliable content saving and retrieval
