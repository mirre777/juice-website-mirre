## 🔥 Immediate Next Steps (Priority 1)

### 1. Complete Payment Integration
**Current State**: Payment button redirects to `/payment?tempId={tempId}` but no payment flow exists.

**What to implement**:
\`\`\`typescript
// Need to create/update these files:
- app/payment/page.tsx (payment form with Stripe)
- app/api/create-payment-intent/route.ts (Stripe payment intent)
- app/api/trainer/activate/route.ts (activation after payment)
\`\`\`

**User Flow**:
1. User clicks "Activate for €29" in temp preview
2. Redirects to payment page with Stripe form
3. Process €29 payment
4. Activate trainer profile with permanent ID
5. Redirect to live trainer website

### 2. Implement Live Trainer Websites
**Current State**: Basic `TrainerProfilePage.tsx` exists but doesn't use the generated content.

**What to implement**:
\`\`\`typescript
// Update these files:
- app/marketplace/trainer/[id]/page.tsx
- app/marketplace/trainer/[id]/TrainerProfilePage.tsx
\`\`\`

**Requirements**:
- Display the same professional design as temp preview
- Use activated trainer data from Firebase
- Remove "preview" elements (timer, activation button)
- Add permanent features (contact forms, booking)

## 💬 Message for Next Chat

"Hi! I'm continuing work on the trainer website creation system (v138). We have a fully functional preview system working - users can submit forms and see professional AI-generated trainer websites with lime green branding, testimonials, and all sections. 

The current system works perfectly through the preview stage, but I need to complete the payment integration (€29 Stripe payment) and activation flow to make trainer profiles live. The temp preview system uses token-based authentication and expires after 24 hours.

Current working URL example: `/marketplace/trainer/temp/kypKDKS1497a4ucqVOzL?token=FdWcetyV6HB1dQAUruJVDrFS7cT7yqDt`

Next priorities:
1. Complete Stripe payment integration 
2. Implement trainer profile activation after payment
3. Update live trainer pages to use the generated content

The system is 75% complete and the preview functionality is working beautifully. Ready to finish the payment and activation flow!"
