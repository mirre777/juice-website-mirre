# Trainer Website Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for the trainer website creation system. The system allows personal trainers to create professional websites through a simple form submission process.

## System Architecture

### 1. Frontend Components
- **PersonalTrainerWebsitePage**: Main form for trainer registration
- **TempTrainerPage**: Preview page for temporary profiles
- **TrainerProfilePage**: Public trainer profile pages
- **TrainerDashboard**: Management interface for trainers
- **TrainerContentEditor**: Content editing interface

### 2. Backend API Routes
- **POST /api/trainer/create**: Creates temporary trainer profiles
- **GET /api/trainer/temp/[tempId]**: Retrieves temporary trainer data
- **POST /api/trainer/activate**: Activates trainer profiles after payment
- **GET /api/trainer/[id]**: Retrieves public trainer profiles
- **PUT /api/trainer/[id]**: Updates trainer profiles

### 3. Database Schema (Firebase Firestore)

#### Trainers Collection
\`\`\`typescript
interface TrainerData {
  id: string
  fullName: string
  email: string
  phone?: string
  location: string
  specialty: string
  experience: string
  bio: string
  certifications?: string
  services: string[]
  status: "temp" | "active" | "inactive"
  createdAt: Timestamp
  expiresAt?: Date
  sessionToken?: string
  isActive: boolean
  isPaid: boolean
  profileImage?: string
  website?: string
  socialLinks?: {
    instagram?: string
    facebook?: string
    twitter?: string
    linkedin?: string
  }
  pricing?: {
    sessionRate?: number
    packageDeals?: string
  }
  availability?: {
    schedule?: string
    timezone?: string
  }
}
\`\`\`

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Registration Flow
1. User fills out trainer registration form
2. Form validation and submission
3. Temporary profile creation
4. Redirect to preview page with session token
5. Profile preview and activation prompt

### 2. Activation Flow
1. User reviews temporary profile
2. Payment processing
3. Profile activation
4. Live website generation
5. Dashboard access provision

### 3. Management Flow
1. Trainer accesses dashboard
2. Content editing and updates
3. Analytics and insights
4. Client management (planned)

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Input validation with Zod schemas
