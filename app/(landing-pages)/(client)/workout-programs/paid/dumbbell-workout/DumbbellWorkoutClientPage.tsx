        answer:
          "You get a complete 3-day workout split: Push day (chest, shoulders, triceps), Pull day (back, biceps), and Legs day (quads, hamstrings, calves). Each workout includes specific exercises, sets, and rep ranges.",

        question: "What equipment do I need?",
        answer:
          "Uhhh... a set of dumbbells? The program is designed to be equipment-minimal while maximizing results. Adjustable dumbbells work best for progression.",
      },
      {
        question: "How often should I do these workouts?",
        answer:
          "Follow the 3-day split: Push, Pull, Legs, then rest or repeat. You can do this 3-6 times per week depending on your recovery and goals. Research shows 10-16 sets per muscle group per week is optimal for muscle growth, which this program delivers perfectly.",

      {
        question: "Is this suitable for beginners?",
        answer:
          "Yes! Start with lighter weights and focus on form. The rep ranges (8-12 for upper body, 12-20 for abs/calves) allow for progression at any level.",
      },
      {
        question: "Why only â‚¬2?",
        answer:
          "We believe effective training shouldn't be expensive. This program gives you everything you need to build muscle with dumbbells at an accessible price.",
