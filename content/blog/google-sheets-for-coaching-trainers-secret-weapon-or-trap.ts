**TL;DR:** Let's be real: fancy coaching apps are sexy. But Google Sheets? That's where trainers roll up their sleeves. Customize whatever you want, track everything, and stay lean on cost. But spoiler: it's not always client-friendly.

## Why Google Sheets Can Work for Coaches

### Zero Software Cost
As one Reddit trainer put it:
> *"The price you can spend upwards of $800 every year on a coaching app, whereas Sheets is absolutely free."*

For solo trainers or those just starting out, that's significant money that can go toward certifications, equipment, or marketing instead of monthly software subscriptions.

### Custom Workflows That Match Your Style
You control everything:
- **Custom formulas** for 1RM calculations, volume tracking, RPE progression
- **Your own tracking systems** that match your exact programming methodology
- **Progression templates** that evolve with your coaching experience
- **Complete data ownership** - no vendor lock-in or subscription cancellations

### Templates That Evolve Over Time
Like this trainer shared:
> *"A functional fitness exercise database in Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets updated each monthâ€”filter by body region, push/pull, etc."*

Your spreadsheets grow with your expertise. Add new exercises, refine formulas, build better tracking systems as you learn what works.

## Client UX: Where It Breaks Down

### Mobile Experience is Brutal
The harsh reality from trainers:
> *"A spreadsheet is a great way to enter info but a terrible way to navigate it on a tiny screen."*

**The problems:**
- Clients click cell-by-cell, scroll endlessly
- Tiny text, accidental edits, formula breaks
- Experience feels amateur compared to polished apps

### Professional Perception Issues
Reddit trainers were blunt:
> *"App is significantly more professional. Unless you've got incredibly well designed sheets, you'll come off like some dollar store trainer."*

**Client expectations in 2025:**
- Sleek interfaces with progress photos
- Push notifications for workouts
- Social features and community aspects
- Video exercise demonstrations built-in

## Pro Tips If You Stick with Sheets

### Optimize for Mobile Experience
**Design for thumbs, not mice:**
- **Large buttons/cells**: Minimum 44px touch targets
- **Clear visual hierarchy**: Bold headers, color coding
- **Separate sheets by week**: Reduce scrolling
- **Dropdown menus**: For exercise selection, RPE ratings

### Build Rich Exercise Databases
**Make it interactive:**
- **Exercise video links**: YouTube embeds or links to form demos
- **Coaching cues**: Text boxes with technique reminders
- **Progress photos**: Google Drive integration for visual tracking
- **Filterable databases**: By body region, equipment, difficulty level

### Create Professional Templates
**Workout templates with:**
- Embedded coaching cues and video links
- Clear progression tracking
- Visual progress indicators
- Professional formatting and branding

### Hybrid Approach Strategy
**Use Sheets for what it does best:**
- Personal training plans and detailed programming
- Complex data analysis and trend tracking
- Custom formulas and calculations

**Switch to apps for:**
- Client-facing interfaces
- Group coaching and community features
- Mobile-first experiences
- Professional presentation

## Conclusion

For solo or niche athletes, Google Sheets is flexible, free, and powerful. But if you're scaling or want polish, pair it with an appâ€”or hand your spreadsheet workflow off to someone who can style it like a pro.

The best system is the one you'll actually use consistently. Whether that's Sheets, apps, or a combination depends on your skills, client base, and business goals.
