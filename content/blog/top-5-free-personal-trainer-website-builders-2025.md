## When to Upgrade to Paid Plans

### You should upgrade when:
- **Getting consistent traffic** (500+ monthly visitors)
- **Ready to remove platform branding** for professionalism
- **Need advanced booking features** or payment processing
- **Want custom domain** (yourname.com instead of platform subdomain)
- **Require more storage** for videos and high-res photos

### Typical upgrade costs:
- **Wix:** $14-39/month
- **WordPress:** $4-25/month
- **Squarespace:** $12-40/month
- **Weebly:** $6-26/month

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Too Much Information
Keep it simple. Confused visitors don't book sessions.

### 2. No Clear Pricing
Even if you prefer custom quotes, give price ranges to qualify leads.

### 3. Generic Stock Photos
Use real photos of you training, your gym, and your clients (with permission).

### 4. Complicated Navigation
Keep menu items to 5 or fewer. Make it easy to find booking information.

### 5. No Contact Information
Make it easy to reach you. Phone, email, and location should be prominent.
