## Why Personal Trainers Need Websites in 2025

Before we dive into the tools, let's address the elephant in the room: "Do I really need a website when I have Instagram?"

- **Control**: Instagram can ban your account tomorrow. Your website is yours forever
- **Conversion**: Websites convert visitors to clients 3x better than social media

- **Professional pricing**: Trainers with websites charge 40% more on average

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Too Much Information
Don't overwhelm visitors with your entire life story on the homepage. Keep it focused on what they need to know to book a session.

### ‚ùå No Clear Pricing
Hiding your prices makes people suspicious. Be transparent about your rates.

### ‚ùå Poor Photos
Blurry, dark, or unprofessional photos kill credibility. Invest in good photos or learn basic smartphone photography.

### ‚ùå No Call-to-Action
Every page should tell visitors what to do next: "Book a Session," "Get Started," "Contact Me."

### ‚ùå Ignoring Mobile
If your site doesn't work well on mobile, you're losing 70% of potential clients.
