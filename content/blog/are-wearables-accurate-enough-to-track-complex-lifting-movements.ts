**TL;DR:** Wearables are everywhere. But when it comes to heavy squats, Olympic lifts, or deadlifts? Are they legit? Let's break down what they do well and where they fail.

## The Wearable Revolution in Strength Training

Walk into any gym today and you'll see them: Apple Watches tracking workouts, Garmin devices monitoring heart rates, WHOOP bands measuring strain. The fitness wearable market is booming, with devices promising to track everything from your morning run to your evening deadlift session.

But here's the million-dollar question: **Are these devices actually accurate enough to track complex lifting movements?**

The short answer? It's complicated.

---

## What Wearables Actually Track Well

### ✅ Cardiovascular Metrics
Wearables excel at monitoring:

- **Heart rate zones** during cardio or metabolic circuits
- **Heart rate variability** for recovery assessment
- **Workout duration** and basic timing
- **Calorie burn estimates** for steady-state cardio

### ✅ Basic Movement Patterns
Most devices can reliably detect:

- **Step counts** and distance for walking/running
- **Stationary exercise metrics** like cycling
- **Workout start/stop** with auto-detection (usually after 10+ minutes)
- **Sleep patterns** and recovery metrics

### ✅ General Activity Levels
They're solid for:

- **Daily activity tracking** and movement goals
- **Sedentary time** monitoring
- **Overall energy expenditure** trends
- **Long-term activity patterns**

## Where They Struggle with Strength Training

### ❌ Calorie Burn Accuracy

**The Reality Check:**
Your Garmin cannot accurately determine how many calories a set of 12 bicep curls burned.

**Why it fails:**
- **Complex energy systems**: Strength training uses different metabolic pathways than cardio
- **Individual variation**: Muscle mass, efficiency, and technique affect calorie burn
- **Recovery periods**: Rest between sets creates irregular energy expenditure patterns
- **Load variations**: 5 reps at 85% 1RM burns differently than 15 reps at 60% 1RM

**Real user experience:**
> *"My Apple Watch says I burned 400 calories during my powerlifting session. I did 5 sets of squats, 5 sets of bench, and 3 sets of deadlifts in 90 minutes. There's no way that's accurate."*

### ❌ Movement Quality Assessment

**What's missing:**
- **Range of motion** tracking
- **Movement velocity** during lifts
- **Form breakdown** detection
- **Eccentric vs. concentric** phase differentiation

**The problem:**
A wearable can't tell the difference between a perfect squat and a quarter-rep. It can't detect if you're compensating with your back during a deadlift or if your bench press bar path is optimal.

### ❌ Load and Intensity Tracking

**Manual input required:**
- **Weight lifted** must be logged separately
- **Sets and reps** need manual entry
- **RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)** requires subjective input
- **Rest periods** between sets aren't automatically tracked

**The tedious reality:**
Logging movements is tedious; often best to auto-track basic metrics and log the important stuff manually.

## The Bottom Line

**Wearables are powerful tools—but they're not your muscle's measure.**

**What they do well:**
- ✅ General activity and health monitoring
- ✅ Heart rate and basic cardiovascular metrics
- ✅ Sleep and recovery tracking
- ✅ Motivation and consistency support

**What they don't do well:**
- ❌ Accurate calorie burn for strength training
- ❌ Movement quality assessment
- ❌ Load and intensity tracking
- ❌ Complex exercise recognition

**The smart approach:**
Use wearables to support your coaching and training, not replace good fundamentals. The best tracker for strength training is still a combination of:

1. **A notebook or app** for weights, sets, and reps
2. **A spreadsheet** for trend analysis
3. **An experienced eye** for form and technique assessment
4. **Wearable data** for recovery and general health metrics

**For trainers:** Educate your clients about what the data means and doesn't mean. Use wearables as engagement tools and trend indicators, not precision instruments.

**For athletes:** Focus on performance metrics that matter—progressive overload, form quality, and how you feel. Let the wearable handle the background health monitoring.

The future will bring better integration and accuracy, but for now, the most important sensor is still the one between your ears.
