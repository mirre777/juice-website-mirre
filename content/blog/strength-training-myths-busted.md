# Strength Training Myths Busted: Prepare to Have Your Gains Questioned (and Then Reaffirmed)

## 💪 **Myth #1: Strength Training Makes You Stiff as a Board**

**Reality:** Actually, it might make you more flexible. A 2023 study says resistance training can improve your range of motion as well as static stretching. So go ahead, squat deep. Overhead press like you mean it. You might actually touch your toes one day. *(No promises, though).*

## 🏋️ **Myth #2: Crunches Will Give You a Six-Pack**

**Reality:** Oh, honey, no. Spot reduction is a myth. Doing a million crunches will only make you really good at crunches. Belly fat says *"hello"* regardless. Fat loss happens with you create an overall caloric deficit and train your whole body. So, put down the ab roller and pick up some weights.

## 🔥 **Myth #3: You Need to Lift Heavy to Build Muscle**

**Reality:** Any weight can build muscle, even the light ones. Apparently, some study with like, 200 other studies said that any load, even if you lift light weights with high frequency, can increase muscle mass and strength. So... technically, you can curl a water bottle and make progress. That said, heavy weights and multiple sets are better, but whatever floats your boat.

## 😤 **Myth #4: Soreness Means Gains**

**Reality:** Being sore just means you tore some stuff. It's Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS). Hypertrophy, which is muscle growth, is driven by progressive overload. In other words, lift more weight over time. Tracking strength and training volume is a better indicator of progress. Being sore just means you probably overdid it. Maybe tone it down, champ.

## 📅 **Myth #5: You Need to Train Every Day**

**Reality:** Working out muscle groups twice a week is optimal for growth. More frequent sessions don't necessarily provide extra benefit unless you significantly increase your volume. So, rest, recover, and focus on getting in 10-20 sets per muscle group per week. You're not lazy; you're optimizing.
